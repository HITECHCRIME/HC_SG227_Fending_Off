## Lyrics

```

"

for the gone people i was fond of
fallen ode to the feeble karma as they snap close             /// (cold)
way too close am i blood, pushed too far i made it far        /// so i made it far
all attachments felt so good from afar 

yet they crashed my spirit's wards
all heirs to their thraws cuz                               /// throne / all them heirs to their own thraws cuz
fig. laments imagination                                      /// figment's
paying price for the cause                                    /// allegiance

groups or packs and tribes they think they right
in their mind, got my own thoughts, never satisfied

(all i can is)

fend off x6
fend off x2 (whisper)

for the gone people i was fond of
fallen ode to the feeble karma as they snap close

feeling clots in my blood
searching through collective thaws

for the gone people i was fond of
fallen ode to the feeble karma as they snap close             /// (cold)
way too close am i blood, pushed too far i made it far        /// so i made it far
all attachments felt so good from afar 

yet they crashed my spirit's wards
all heirs to their thraws cuz                               /// throne / all them heirs to their own thraws cuz
fig. laments imagination                                      /// figment's
paying price for the cause                                    /// allegiance

groups or packs and tribes they think they right
in their mind, got my own thoughts, never satisfied

(all i can is)

fend off x6
fend off x2 (whisper)
