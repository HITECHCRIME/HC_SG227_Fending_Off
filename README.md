## Lyrics

```
for the gone people i was fond of
fallen ode to the feeble karma as they snap close

way too close am i blood 
pushed too far (so) i made it far                  /// (clots in my blood)
all attachments felt so good from afar

yet they crashed my spirit's wards
all (them) heirs to the own thraws cuz             /// throne
fig laments  imagination                           /// figment's
paying price for the cause                         /// allegiance

groups or packs and tribes they think they right
in their mind, got my own thoughts, never satisfied

(all i can is)

fend off x6
fend off x2 (whisper)

for the gone people i was fond of
fallen ode to the feeble karma as they snap close

```
